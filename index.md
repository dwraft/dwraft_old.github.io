# Welcome to My Page


Hi! My name is Daniel Wrafter. I am a third year CS major and Math Minor at MIT. Please feel free to contact me at dwrafter@mit.edu if you are interested in working together. Currently, I am open to internships for Summer 2020, full time roles for 2021, as well as part time work during the academic year. You can check out my full resume [here](https://github.com/dwraft/dwraft.github.io/blob/master/documents/DanielWrafterResume.pdf)


# Education

I will be graduating from MIT in Spring 2020 with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering as well as a minor in mathematics. Additionally, I plan on graduating from the MIT [MEng](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/undergraduate-programs/6-p-meng-program) program in Spring 2021 with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence.

# My Work Experience

## Freshman Summer (2017)

I worked as a reseacher at [CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)on the [START](http://start.mit.edu/index.php) Natural Language Answering System.

## Sophomore Summer (2018)

I worked in Quantitative Research at Tiger Global Asset Management.

* Built software to analyze financial data and backtest trading algorithms

## Junior Fall

I worked part time on developing and testing motion tracking technology for sports at [Figur8](https://figur8tech.com/) in Boston 

* Anonymized videos using OpenCV using facial recognition and regression techniques

* Built and extended tools for analyzing discrete time biomedical signals

## Junior Winter

I designed lesson plans taught high school level mathematics at ITE Enrico Tosi in Busto Arsizio Italy.


I am especially excited about this interactive lesson which teaches digital image processing using only basic linear algebra methods. [Math of Images](https://github.com/dwraft/GTL2019/blob/master/MathOfImages.ipynb)

## Junior Summer (2019)

I will be working at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/careers) in Califronia.


# Skills

I write most of my code in Python, but also am comfortable with Java, and have worked lightly with C, C++, SQL, Julia, tensorflow, OpenCV JavaScript and R in the past. I have used Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, Plotly and Julia extensively for data science and data visualization.


In addition to my technical skills, I have built strong communication skills through teaching and writing.


# Writing


When I'm not studying or coding, I like to write from time to time.

# Some things I'm working on.

I am currently teaching high school mathematics abroad at ITE Enrico Tosi. I've built some fun lessons using Jupyter, incooporating data visualizations from plotly and matplotlib, which are posted [here](https://dwraft.github.io/GTL2019/).
